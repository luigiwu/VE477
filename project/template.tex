\begin{overview}
\item [Algorithm:] name~(algo.~\ref{problemnb}) 
% - replace nb with problem number (e.g. problem101)
% -	must match the label of the algorithm 
% - for more than one algo list each of them and use problem101a, problem101b, problem101c etc.
\item [Input:] what inputs are expected
\item [Complexity:] complexity of the algorithm, e.g. $\mathcal{O}(n)$
\item [Data structure compatibility:] data structures that can be used with the algorithm; N/A if unrelated
\item [Common applications:] most common fields where this algorithm is used
\end{overview}



\begin{problem}{\pbname}
Precise and concise formal definition of the problem.
\end{problem}

\subsection*{Description}
Detailed description of the problem; More detailed information on the input and complexity; more applications with details on how they relate to each other (if this is the case).

% add comment in the pseudocode: \cmt{comment}
% define a function name: \SetKwFunction{shortname}{Name of the function}
% use the defined function: \shortname{$variables$}
% use the keyword ``function'': \Fn{function name}, e.g. \Fn{\shortname{$var$}}
\begin{Algorithm}[name\label{problemnb}]
	% - replace nb with problem number (e.g. problem101)
% -	must match the reference in the overview
% - when writing more than one algo use problem101a, problem101b, problem101c etc.
